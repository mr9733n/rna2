# Flask Web Application

This Flask-based web application offers a variety of interactive features, including coin flipping, random number analysis, and Japanese name generation. Designed with user interaction in mind, it provides both web interfaces and an API for generating Japanese names.

## Features

- **Coin Flip**: Simulate a coin flip to get a random result of heads or tails.
- **Random Number Analysis**: Analyze a set of random numbers based on user-defined parameters.
- **Japanese Name Generator**: Generate random Japanese names with options for gender specificity and saving the results to a file.
- **API for Name Generation**: A RESTful API endpoint to generate Japanese names programmatically.
- **Password Generator**: Password Generator

## Installation

To set up this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mr9733n/rna2.git
   ```
2. Create Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t rna401 ./rna2/
   ```
3. Start Docker container:
   ```
   docker run -p 37112:37112 rna401
   ```

## Usage

After starting the Flask server, navigate to `http://localhost:37112` in your web browser to access the application.

### Web Interface

- Navigate to the respective routes (`/`, `/random_heads_tails`, `/random_top_analyze`, `/random_japanese_names`) to access the different features.
- Use the forms provided on each page to interact with the features and view the results.

### API Usage

To generate Japanese names via the API, send a GET request to `/api/generate_names` with the following query parameters:

- `num_names`: Number of names to generate (integer).
- `sex`: Gender for the names ('male' or 'female').
- `save_to_file`: Boolean to determine if the names should be saved to a file.

Example API request:
```
GET http://localhost:37112/api/generate_names?num_names=5&sex=male&save_to_file=true
```

## Configuration

The application's behavior can be modified through various configurations present in the `random_top_analyze` module.
